  In order to minimize the spread of the Covid 19 virus we are temporarily
  modifying our payment options.

In order to prevent the further spread of covid 19, we have closed the lobby and are not taking payments through the drive through window. If at all possible, please pay online, by phone or by mail.  If you need to pay with cash, we ask you to put the payment in an envelope with your name/account number and drop it in the night drop box in our drive thru at 238 Broadway.   If paying by phone call 1-844-291-4855.  If you have not signed up online or would like to set up auto pay and need assistance please don't hestiate to call our office.
