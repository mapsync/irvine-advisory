**In order to avoid service disruptions, delinquent balances must be paid IN FULL by the cut-off date.....NO EXCEPTIONS**

IMU water/sewer bills due on **16th** of every month.  If not paid by the 16th, a 10% penalty will be added to bill.  

Cut-off date for delinquent IMU water/sewer balances occur the first week of the following month after the due date (16th).

Estill County Water District customers who have delinquent sewer bills with IMU are subject to cut-off also but cut-off date is determined by the Estill County Water District.
