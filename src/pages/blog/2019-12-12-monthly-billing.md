IMU water/sewer bills due on 16th of every month.  If not paid by the 16th, a 10% penalty will be added to bill.  

Cut-off date for delinquent IMU  water/sewer balances occur the first week of the following month.

Estill County Water District customers who have delinquent sewer bills with IMU are subject to cut-off also but cut-off date is determined by the Estill County Water District.
